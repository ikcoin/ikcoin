### Hi there 👋

I'm Bernat, a Computer Engineer from Barcelona, currently working as a Blockchain Developer, who is passionate about 🔗 ₿lockchain Technology 🔗 and ⚡ Distributed Ledgers ⚡. 

- 🚀 I’m currently working on a timestamp project using the Roughtime protocol and Bitcoin, Ethereum & Cardano Blockchains. 
- 🖇 I enjoy participating in new DeFi projects to test new blockchain networks and providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges.
- 😚 One of the projects I am most proud of is my final degree project, which was [A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Vue dApp demo on the RSK blockchain with basic functionalities such as Add Liquidity and Swap ERC20 tokens](https://github.com/ikcoin/tfg-rsk-swap)
- ☕ Addicted to (good) Coffee, V60 is my daily driver. 
- ⌨️ I'm a Mechanical Keyboard enthusiast, I love the ergonomic Alice layout and I enjoy contributing to the community with projects like [this one](https://github.com/ikcoin/IkCase).
